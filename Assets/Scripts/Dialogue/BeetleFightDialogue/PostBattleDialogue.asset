  - bodyText: "Excellent. Since the beetles seem to be attracted to Waste Products,
      the city\u2019s collection of Products could spell trouble. All the examiners
      agree that it would be best to deal with the beetles now before they become
      an even larger problem."

      of attack to neutralize the beetle swarm."
