      lowered their numbers some. We\u2019ve sustained some injuries, but we can
      definitely take out the rest of the nest now. That was some quick thinking,
      Jackie. You\u2019re cut out to be a leader."

  - bodyText: "Thanks, Ives. Though, I\u2019m finding it kind of hard to distinguish
      the beetles from the crystals. I wonder how the two are connected\u2026 Do
      you think they rely on the crystals for survival somehow?"

  - bodyText: "That\u2019s a possibility. Maybe their life force is embedded in the
      crystals."

      make them easier to take down!"
