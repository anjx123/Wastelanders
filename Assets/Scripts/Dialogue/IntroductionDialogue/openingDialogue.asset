  - bodyText: Hey have you heard? Apparently, Jackie is trying out for the NITES
      exam again.
    speakerName: Laid-back Soldier
  - bodyText: What? Again? After her performance last year, do you think she really
      is prepared to try again?
    speakerName: Puzzled Soldier
  - bodyText: "Beats me. If I were her, I\u2019d take it easy and spend a couple
      more years training. "
    speakerName: Laid-back Soldier
  - bodyText: I've heard horror stories about what the NITES have to deal with in
      the Wasteland.
    speakerName: Laid-back Soldier
  - bodyText: Do you think shes going for the achievement of being the youngest to
      join the NITES?
    speakerName: Laid-back Soldier
  - bodyText: "No I don\u2019t think so, wasn\u2019t her mother younger than her
      when she scored top marks on that exam?"
    speakerName: Puzzled Soldier
  - bodyText: "Hmm right, guess going on NITES\u2019 wasteland expeditions runs in
      the family. I think life inside the Wall is much more peaceful."
    speakerName: Puzzled Soldier
  - bodyText: 'Of course you do... But do you really plan on being just a grunt forever? '
    speakerName: Puzzled Soldier
  - bodyText: Mmm, maybe I'll give that exam a shot in a couple years.
    speakerName: Laid-back Soldier
  - bodyText: "Then come on, we should get to training. Pass or not, the fact that
      she\u2019s trying makes us look like chumps"
