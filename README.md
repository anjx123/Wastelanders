# Gameplay Loop
The gameplay seeks to innovate on traditional turned based RPG's where the players attack, then patiently wait for the enemies to respond. In Wastelanders, you and your enemies will clash together head on based on power and agility to duke it out.

## Combat
Every round, enemies will declare an intention to attack against characters in the player's party.
In response, you select attacks from your hand crafted deck from each member in the team to respond against the enemy attacks.
When targeting an attack directed at a character, the attacks form a 'clash' and will compete to see which card rolls the highest power during the fight. 
The higher power card staggers the opponent attack, causing their attack to lose their attack, while also dealing damage. 
Making this a game about expected value, strategy, and decision making to make your clashes count.  

### Card Keywords:
üí•Power: If the attack lands, deal power as amount of damage. Important to win clashes against the enemy. 

üõ°Ô∏èBlock: Gains block equal to block value that reduces oncoming damage by consuming an equal amount of block.

‚ö°Speed: Determines what order the attacks are delivered. The higher the value, the faster the attack will come out. (Useful to stagger the enemy before they can attack)
